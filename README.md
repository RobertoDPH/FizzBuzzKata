# [FizzBuzz Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/)

## Stage 1

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for
multiples of five prints "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

## Stage 2 - new requirements

+ A number is Fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
+ A number is Buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it

For example: 

+ 53 should return "FizzBuzz" (contains 5 and 3)
+ 35 should return "FizzBuzzBuzz" (contains 5 and 3 and it divided by 5)
